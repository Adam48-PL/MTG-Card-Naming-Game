Hello, if you are reading this, it means you opened README.md

This is a basically a Magic: The Gathering card naming game. In other words, you have to use your nerd powers to name as many cards possible.
Tokens, vanguards, planes, art series, hosts and augments are not included. Doubled faced cards have to be typed as Name1 // Name2
